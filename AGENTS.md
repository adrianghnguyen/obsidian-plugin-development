# Agent notes

## Cursor plugin install (this repo)

- **Local `:latest`:** `~/.cursor/plugins/local/obsidian-plugin-development` should be a junction to this working tree (`C:\Coding_projects\obsidian-plugin-development`), not a pinned marketplace commit. After skill edits: **Developer: Reload Window**.
- **Marketplace unpin:** Personal `/add-plugin` installs pin to the first commit; `marketplace update` does not advance them. Use `powershell -File scripts/refresh-cursor-marketplace.ps1` (remove + wipe cache + re-add `--git-ref main`).
- **Post-push:** `scripts/git-hooks/post-push` runs that refresh after `git push`. Install once: `powershell -File scripts/git-hooks/install.ps1`. Reload Cursor after push.
